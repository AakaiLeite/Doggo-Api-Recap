## Instructions

### Clone the Repo and Install NPM Packages

Hint: you have already the package-lock.json. So, after cloning the lab, you should only need to 'npm install' to download the npm packages that are needed 😉

### 1st Interation: Display 5 Random Images on your Homepage

After having your project configured, check your app.js file. There you will find some basic Express / HBS configurations with already two 'GET' request routes created. 

Let's start with the first one. Inside GET '/' you should call your Doggo API to retrieve you 5 random Dog Photos. 

How can you do that? No less, no more - everything you need is here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/doggo-api-wrapper
